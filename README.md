## What I am working on
During the day, I work at Data Search as member of the executive team in charge of project management for clients and vendors mainly focused on their data integration for order processing.  

## What I am currently learning
Right now I am learning how to use github. I've used it sparingly in the past but decided to go back to the beginning and get a good baseline to my understanding.
